Q: What makes a hacking spot awesome?

> A place where you would go and take your friends to go hacking with, power and wifi are a plus, having coffee and snacks is a bonus. We are excluding, for now, places that require a subscription or membership of some kind (unless that membership can be done at the moment of the visit and it doesn't require a long-term commitment).
